We believe in furthering the work of Community Schools, but from a bottom-up, not top-down, approach. We believe that students, workers, and communities should have more of a say as to how our public institutions are ran, not disconnected politicians. We need to reclaim public education for the public.",

We must fight for an education system that truly values our education workers. We will advocate for a $70,000 Teacher Minimum Annual Salary. A $25 dollar an hour living wage for Classified employees. We’re going to cut from the top, starting with our office. Our campaign believes that our education system favors a business model type governance, where district superintendents are paid like CEOs of major companies. We believe that Billionaires should not profit from our public schools, we believe that most Californians believe this too. We are going to fight for a public education system that values its workers.",

We won’t be puppets of the Governor.",

We will provide our community colleges, universities, and trade schools with the funds needed to appropriately meet the needs of all our students with an IEP.

One way that our CDE will respect the cultural and human integrity of our First Nations people is by making sure that their languages and cultures are valued and taught in our public schools. Additionally, many of our students and families are Indigenous immigrants from Mexico, Central America, and South America.
