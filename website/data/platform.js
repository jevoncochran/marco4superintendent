Our campaign believes that our education system favors a business model type governance, where district superintendents are paid like CEOs of major companies. We are going to cut from the top. We believe that Billionaires shouldn’t exist, we believe that most Californians believe this too. We are going to fight for a public education system that is for the public.",

Consequently, we also believe that schools should not have Police. We propose the creation of a one-year committee composed of Activists, Formerly Incarcerated People, Engaged Critical Scholars, and Families to create a comprehensive and critical proposal to get every Student Resource Officer (SRO) out of our schools; additionally, the plan must propose what our students and employees would require to be safe in our schools.",

    text: "The California Ethnic Studies Now Coalition and their work must be respected. We need Ethnic Studies from Kindergarten to our Ph.D. programs and everywhere in between. The Department of Education will follow the leadership of the grassroot movements. We will hold Governor Newsome accountable; we will impose pressure from below and above; we will get an Ethnic Studies Curriculum that represents the full pedagogical tenets of Ethnic Studies. We won’t be puppets of the Governor. In similar fashion to Ethnic Studies, the DOE will develop a pathway to implement Gender and Women Studies in our K-Grad Schools through the leadership of those at forefront of this educational movement. Education is the practice of freedom. If we believe this, then we believe that education should facilitate the nurturing of our student's sense of self. There is no freedom without knowledge of self.",

The Department of Education will aim to increase the recruitment and retention of Special Education Teachers and will value the expertise they bring into the classroom. We will propose a whole set of systemic reforms that will dramatically change the profession as we know it, to help Special Education teachers do what they do best, teach. Students will receive the appropriate resources and accommodations to meet their IEP Goals and Transition Goals. We will provide our community colleges, universities, and trade schools with the funds needed to appropriately meet the needs of all our students with an IEP. Students with a dis/Ability have the right to a dignified life. A different world for them is possible.",
